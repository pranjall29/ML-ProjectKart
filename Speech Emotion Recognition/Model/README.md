**GOAL**
The goal is to predict the emotion of human while talking.


**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- I have explored the audio files.
- Make models according which can predict emotions effectively.
- I have plotted the results of the prediction.

**MODELS USED**
-  MLP
-  SVM

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- librosa
- seaborn

**CONCLUSION**
Accuracy of all models are evaluated 

By using MLP Classifier I got 
 ```python
    Accuracy:   76.44%
 ``` 

By using Scaled SVC I got 
 ```python
    Accuracy:   63.80597014925373%
 ``` 

 By using Unscaled SVC I got 
 ```python
    Accuracy:   68.28358208955224%
