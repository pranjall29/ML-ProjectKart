# Covid-19 : Data Analysis
On 30 January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The COVID-19 crisis is putting high pressure on the research community to speed up science discovery, inform the public health response and help save lives, as demonstrated by the activation by the WHO of the R&D Blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel virus. A necessary complementary action to accelerate and amplify impact is to ensure that research findings and data relevant to this outbreak, are shared as rapidly, openly and effectively as possible.Therefore, the European Commission urges researchers of Horizon 2020 grants with research outputs that - in any way - may be used to advance the research on COVID-19, to provide immediate open access to their related publications, data and any other output possible, in line with the guidance offered in this document. These can be projects specifically researching on the corona virus, but also other research fields/disciplines with relevance to tackle the corona crisis. Similarly, the European Commission urges research infrastructures projects, developing and/or providing access services to relevant research tools and resources, to provide priority and customised access to their services for research on COVID-19.More particularly, the European Commission strongly encourages beneficiaries to follow the guidelines below, thereby exceeding the current Open Access requirements of Horizon 2020 and going beyond the legal obligations enshrined in the Horizon 2020 Grant Agreement (GA), in order to address the current public health emergency. The guidelines build on both the commitments made by the European Commission as a signatory of the Statement on Data Sharing in Public Health Emergency, and on the principles established in the GA.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to Analyze the situation caused due to Covid-19 pandemic, how were the countries affected, how were the confirmed cases increased day by day, how the death toll rose, and also what have the major countries done to face off the challenge and how they overcome the situation, whether the implementation of the lockdown was successful or, not, everything will be analyzed in this project.  

## Dataset
The dataset which I am going to use easily available in the Kaggle. Here is the link for the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset. Also I'll be uploading the dataset in the [`Dataset`](https://github.com/abhisheks008/ML-ProjectKart/tree/patch-28/Covid-19%20Data%20Analysis/Abhishek%20Sharma/Dataset) folder too, so that you can directly use that dataset.

******************************************************
## Conclusion
Upto this data analysis these are following things we can conclude - 
1. **228 Countries were affected by Covid-19**

2. **USA** is the worst affected country in terms of Covid 19 with 19.57% share of the confirmed cases of the world.

3. After USA, **India and Brazil** are at the second and third place respectively with 16.41% and 9.69% holdings on the Covid-19 confirmed cases share.

4. **Recovery rate of India is the highest among all countries.**

5. **In terms of Death rate Brazil is at the highest point.**

6. **Hubei** is the place, where Covid-19 surge was first detected.

7. Graphs of China shows that they have controlled everything!

8. But the world excluding China is still suffering from this, and the cases are growing exponentially with no brake!

9. The whole world except China is facing the Third wave of the Covid surge.

10. **Italy** have controlled the situation but unfortunately, they have broken down again as the confirmed cases are increasing exponentially, than the previous waves.

11. Italy's second and third waves are one of the scariest pandemic situation.

12. **USA** is the worst affected country, although the vaccination is going on but still the cases are  increasing exponentially. USA is at the fourth wave of this pandemic.

13. **South Korea** was annouced as the most successful country in terms of fighting against covid, but they too have broken down as the second and third wave hit them so hard.They are now fighting against the fourth wave of this pandemic.

14. While talking about **UK**, this is the only major country that has successfully tackled the situation, although they have suffered three waves of covid surge but after that they have held up the fourth wave and the confirmed cases graph tells the story!

15. **Germany**, another economic giant, was able to successfully tackle the first wave but broken down on second and third wave, just like South Korea. Germany is eager to control the situation and waneted to hold the fourth wave.

16. Tech giant **Japan**, is not performing well, as they are facing the fourth wave of pandemic. The third and fourth wave of Covid-19 demolished their health facilities. They are eager to control the fourth wave.

17. **Australia**, the countries of Kangaroos, held up the pandemic only at the second wave without imposing strict lockdown. Now from the last 10-12 months the cases are like 50-60 per day, which shows the control over the pandemic, despite of the fact that the world is suffering from the same virus.

18. **Lockdown for major countries, was successful or not!** Let's find out using this chart -

|Country|Lockdown|
|:---:|:---:|
|China|Successful|
|Italy|Successful|
|United States of America|Unsuccessful|
|Germany|Successful|
|Australia|Successful|
|Japan|Successful|

19. **India, the fastest growing epicenter**, only the second wave has hit India, but it seems like fourth wave is there. The per day confirmed cases count were 400000, which shows the condition of this country. Only the second wave is there, third wave is yet to come. But for India the plus point is the recovered cases rate, which is highest among all the countries, but despite of that, India is the second worst affected country.
Now talking about Lockdown in India, the government imposed lockdown early, so that they can control the pandemic, but that didn't go their way. As soon as the lockdown revoked the cases were jumped in a rocket speed. Never ever you can see the curve of India to be flatten for a long amount of time like Australia or, UK, once the cases were decreased, at that very moment, another spike of cases comes out. For India, Lockdown implementation was barely unsuccessful and it showed up in the following times! As lockdown did nothing to control the surge.
