# Water Quality

## GOAL
 
Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.

## Dataset

You can download dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability)

## What I had Done

* Firstly we Clear the data and handled the missing Values:

![After](https://github.com/Isha307/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/Water%20Quality/Images/filled%20values.png)

* I did some feature scaling and feature Engineering.

* Checked the accuracy using different classification algorithm.

* Created Model using Supprt Vector Machine.
