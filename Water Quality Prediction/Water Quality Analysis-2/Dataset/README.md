# About Dataset

Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection.
This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, 
it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, 
since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.
