**GOAL**

The goal is to predict  Quality.

Dataset can be downloaded from [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/-potability)

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Discussed some major columns on which  quality depends.
- Handling outliers of diagnosis columns. As, it is very important because at last we're predicting  quality.
- Then I used different classification models present in sklearn to train the model.
- Use Correlation coefficients to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables.

**MODELS USED**
-  Logistic Regression
-  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-  Decission Tree
-  K Nearest Neighbour
-  Naive Bayes
-  Random  Classifier

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

**CONCLUSION**
By using Logistic Regression I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 59.613956941351155
    Accuracy of testing data: 60.24096385542169
