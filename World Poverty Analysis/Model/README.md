# World Poverty Analysis
At the dawn of the 21st century we are still a long way from achieving what has eluded humanity for thousands of years, a world free from hunger and poverty. The past thirty years, however, have brought us closer to reaching this goal in a large part of the developing world. The lives of millions have been transformed at a pace unparalleled in human history and to an extent that would have seemed unthinkable only a generation ago.

However, there is no room for complacency. Even today, close to 1.2 billion people - a fifth of the world's population - continue to live in conditions of abject poverty. Almost 800 million people in the developing world are chronically hungry. A basic right, the right to adequate and nutritious food, which most people take for granted, remains a distant dream for those who fight with food shortages every day of their lives. The presence of deep poverty and hunger on such a vast scale in a world of apparent opulence is a moral outrage.

## Dataset
In this project the datasets that I have used are collected from Kaggle. Here are the links :
1. Kiva crowdfunding dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding
2. Multidimensional poverty measures : https://www.kaggle.com/ophi/mpi
3. World population : https://www.kaggle.com/walla2ae/world-population

Also I have uploaded the same in the [`Dataset`](https://github.com/abhisheks008/ML-ProjectKart/tree/patch-32/World%20Poverty%20Analysis/Dataset) folder, you can collect that too!

2. South Sudan is having highest population suffering from poverty.
3. Kazakhstan is having lowest population suffering from poverty.

7. Poverty in Afghanistan
    1. The Rural population of Afghanistan has more proportion of people living under poverty line.
