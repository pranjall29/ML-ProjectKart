# Colour Identification using Machine Learning

**GOAL**
A very common task in Computer Vision is based on identifying colours.
More generally, a fascinating aspect of learning is that sometimes we know things but we can’t explain them. 
For example, if I ask you to describe me the “red colour” your only option is to show me a red object, but you can’t really explain what “red” is.
For this reason a certain effort is necessary to transmit the definition of a colour to a computer.

**DATASET**

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
I have used OpenCV and Pandas library to choose a point on any particular image and calculate the RGB of that point and match it with the nearest colour in the dataset to predict the colour.

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
OpenCV and Pandas
