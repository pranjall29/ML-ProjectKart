Here to build this model we are going to use, two datasets so that we have a large amount of data to train and test the classification models.
1. Spotify Mega Dataset :  https://www.kaggle.com/iamsumat/spotify-top-2000s-mega-dataset
2. Spotify 2010-2019 songs Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year

I have also uploaded these two datasets in this folder, you can access from there too.
