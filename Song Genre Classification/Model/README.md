# Song Genre Classification
Spotify, with a net worth of $26 billion, is reigning the music streaming platform today. It currently has millions of songs in its database and claims to have the right music score for everyone. Spotifyâ€™s Discover Weekly service has become a hit with the millennials. Needless to say, Spotify has invested a lot in research to improve the way users find and listen to music. Machine Learning is at the core of their research. From NLP to Collaborative filtering to Deep Learning, Spotify uses them all. Songs are analyzed based on their digital signatures for some factors, including tempo, acoustics, energy, danceability, etc.

The task at hand is to categorize songs into certain categories (trap, rap, pop etc) based off of given values such as danceability, acousticness and other metrics that can be readily obtained via Spotify's organize playlist.  

Note that both sets of data use the same metrics available off of Spotify's organize playlist feature. These metrics are as follows:
1. **Genre** - the genre of the track
2. **Year** - the release year of the recording. Note that due to vagaries of releases, re-releases, re-issues and general madness, sometimes the release years are not what you'd expect.
3. **Added** - the earliest date you added the track to your collection.
4. **Beats Per Minute** (BPM) - The tempo of the song.
5. **Energy** - The energy of a song - the higher the value, the more energtic. song
6. **Danceability** - The higher the value, the easier it is to dance to this song.
7. **Loudness** (dB) - The higher the value, the louder the song.
8. **Liveness** - The higher the value, the more likely the song is a live recording.
9. **Valence** - The higher the value, the more positive mood for the song.
10. **Length** - The duration of the song.
11. **Acousticness** - The higher the value the more acoustic the song is.
12. **Speechiness** - The higher the value the more spoken word the song contains.
13. **Popularity** - The higher the value the more popular the song is.
14. **Duration** - The length of the song.

## Goal
The Goal of this project is to build the classification model using the Spotify dataset.

## Dataset
Here to build this model we are going to use, two datasets so that we have a large amount of data to train and test the classification models.
1. Spotify Mega Dataset :  https://www.kaggle.com/iamsumat/spotify-top-2000s-mega-dataset
2. Spotify 2010-2019 songs Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year

I have also uploaded these two datasets in the [`Dataset`](https://github.com/abhisheks008/ML-ProjectKart/tree/patch-13/Song%20Genre%20Classification/Dataset) folder, you can access from there too.

## What have I done
1. Loading and importing all the libraries, check [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/abhisheks008/ML-ProjectKart/blob/patch-13/Song%20Genre%20Classification/requirements.txt).
2. Importing the dataset in the Jupyter Notebook.
3. After I have done the following things -
    - Data Preparation for Classifier Model
    - Spliting the Genres in the dataset
        - Method 1
        - Method 2
    - Classifier Model Creation
        - Spliting the dataset
        - Deploying the Classifier Models
        - Cross Validation Score
        - Accuracy Metrices
4. Conclusion

## Libraries used
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. sklearn
5. seaborn


## Model Comparison
We have deployed four machine learning algorithms and every algorithm is deployed successfully without any hesitation. We have checked the accuracy of the models based on the accuracy score of each of the models. Now let's take a look at the scores of each models.

|Name of the Model|Cross Validation Score|Precision Score|Recall Score|F-Measure Score|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Logistic Regression|0.56|0.56|0.56|0.56|
|Random Forest Classifier|0.37|0.71|0.37|0.49|
|Gradient Descent Algorithm|0.49|0.52|0.51|0.51|
|Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm|0.41|0.41|0.41|0.41|

## Conclusion
**Comparing all those scores scored by the machine learning algorithms, it is clear that Logistic Regression is having the upper hand in case of this dataset and after this, we can use Gradient Descent Classifier which are also having good score as compared to the other deployed algorithms**

Best Fitted Models ranking - 
1. Logistic Regression
2. Gradient Descent Algorithm
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier

Hooray!! The models are deployed successfully!
