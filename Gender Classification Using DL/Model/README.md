# Introduction to Gender Classification
The Gender classification is gaining more and more attention, as gender contains rich and distinguished information about the social activities of men and women. Gender classification aims to recognize a personâ€™s gender based on the characteristics that differentiate masculinity and femininity.

In the field of artificial intelligence, gender classification is considered to be one of the most important applications of the pattern recognition method. Advances in gender classification research have led to many potential applications.

# About the Model :
Gathering a large, labeled image training set for age and
gender estimation from social image repositories requires
either access to personal information on the subjects appearing in the images (their birth date and gender), which
is often private, or is tedious and time-consuming to manually label. Data-sets for age and gender estimation from
real-world social images are therefore relatively limited in
size and presently no match in size with the much larger image classification data-sets
Overfitting is common problem when machine learning
based methods are used on such small image collections.
This problem is exacerbated when considering deep convolutional neural networks due to their huge numbers of model
parameters. Care must therefore be taken in order to avoid
overfitting under such circumstances.
