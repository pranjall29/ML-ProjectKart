**GOAL**

The goal is to predict Zoo animals.

Dataset can be downloaded from [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/zoo-animal-classification?select=class.csv)

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Discussed some major columns on which the category of the zoo animals depends.
- Handling outliers of diagnosis columns. As, it is very important because at last we're predicting zoo animals.
- Then I used different classification models present in sklearn to train the model.
-  Use Correlation coefficients to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables.

**MODELS USED**
-  Logistic Regression
-  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-  K Nearest Neighbour

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

**Conclusion**

 By using Logistic Regression I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of Training Data:  100.0
    Accuracy of Testing Data:  96.7741935483871
 ``` 
 By using Support Vector Machine I got
