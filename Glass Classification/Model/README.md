#### From the model comparison it is evident that the Random Forest Classifier gives the best results with a score of 83.72%.Now, we are going to build a Keras Sequential model to check whether it performs better than the Random Forest Classifier.

- **Keras Sequential Model**
    -  *Validation Accuracy - 95.24%*
    -  *Testing Accuracy - 90.91%*

**Conclusion**

In this project we have performed a analysis and visualization of the training dataset with different Exploratory Data Analysis techniques. Then a comparative analysis of different ML Classifiers have been done to predict type of glass. After performing the comparative analysis of the classifiers, we can see that the Random Forest Classifier gives the best results with a score of 83.72%. However to get better accuracy we build a Keras Sequential model which gives a validation accuracy of 95.24% and Testing accuracy of 90.91%.
