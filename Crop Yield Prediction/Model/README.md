**Project Title**

Crop Yield Prediction

**GOAL**

This dataset is focused on the different crops which can reflect the price area and other attributes from that one can predict for future price yield by using some better attributes.


**WHAT I HAD DONE**

- With the help of EDA and machine learning algorithm in Crop Yield Prediction for helping the  farmers with better yield and proper conditions   with places. 
- I use Random Forest, Decision Tree and KNN machine learning algorithms to predict the future price of crops and find out Random Forest is the   best models for prediction.
- Before that I analyze the data and perform EDA and in EDA I clean the data and use visualization techniques to find out useful insights.
- Hence the model built successfully and is ready to predict the Crop Price Prediction.

**MODELS USED**

-  K-Nearest Neighbors
-  Random Forest Regressor
-  Decision Tree Regressor

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- One hot encoding
- category_encoders


**CONCLUSION**

 By using K-nearest neighbors I got 
 ```python
    Test set Accuracy:   0.550348295508295
 ``` 
By using Random Forest Regressor I got 
 ```python
    Test set Accuracy:   0.9735367065373357
 ``` 
By using Decision Tree Regressor I got 
 ```python
    Test set Accuracy:   0.960289435184359
 ```
