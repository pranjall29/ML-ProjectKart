# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification

Diagnosis of brain tumors in the early stages of the tumor’s start is difficult because it cannot accurately measure the size and resolution of the tumor. Therefore, the treatment of tumor depends on the timely diagnosis of the tumor. 

For skilled radiologists, analysis of multimodal MRI scans can take up to 20 minutes. Since manual image feature extraction methods are very time inefficient, limited to operator experience, and are prone to human error, a reliable and fully automatic classification method using MRI data is necessary for efficient cancer detection.

This model detects the presence of brain tumor by processing MRI scans of the patient. If the presence of tumor is detected, it is then classified into ‘Glioma’, ‘Pituitary’ or ‘Meningioma’. This automated detection technique facilitates accurate, efficient and cost-effective detection of brain tumors whilst alleviating the bottleneck of limited diagnosis time for doctors.
