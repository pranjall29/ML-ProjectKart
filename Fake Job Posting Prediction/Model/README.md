**Fake Jobs Posting Prediction**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to predict the whether the employee with jods has fake job or real.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Preparation
- Step 3: Data visualization
- Step 4: Data Training
- Step 5: Model Creation
- Step 6: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K Neighbors Classifier



**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- warnings
- nltk
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
- By using Random Forest model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  99.99
 ``` 
 - By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  18.03
 ``` 
- By using Ridge Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  17.98
 ``` 
 - By using K Neighbors Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  96.92
 ``` 
**Conclusion:**
- Accuracy of Regression models- Linear regression, rigde regression is almost same.
- Whereas accuracy of Random Forest is higher and root mean square error is least.
- Random Forest is more efficient model.
