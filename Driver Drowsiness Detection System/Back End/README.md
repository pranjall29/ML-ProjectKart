**HOW IT WORKS**

- User must click on the start button on the website in order to start with the project.You can view ![image](E:\github\ML-ProjectKart\Driver Drowsiness Detection System\Images\home_page.PNG)

- A gui opens where you need to click *Run* and the camera will start running to detect your face and then your eyes

- Then the pre- processing is done, where it crops the eye images and resizes it to 224*224 which can be fed to the model

- If the eyes are open, the status will be shown as **Active** else it will show as **Sleep Alert** along with an alarm sound to awake the driver

- To stop the camera from running, press **q** button from the keyboard..

- To run the project locally, run the test1.py file
