# Advertisement Click Prediction
Machine Learning has now variety of applications in real world whether it is for predictive analysis or automating things or decision making for business purpose. Having knowledge of Machine Learning is different thing but applying it to business purpose for making profit, and learning something new from the data is the main motive. So keeping these points in mind recently I have done a project which was a Machine Learning competition. Project was about predicting the ad click rate of a customer, based on certain features. I found this problem very interesting and therefore made a Machine Learning model to predict the Ad click.

## Dataset
The dataset which is used in this project, is collected from Kaggle. Here is the link of the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/jahnveenarang/cvdcvd-vd. I have uploaded the same in [`Dataset`](https://github.com/abhisheks008/ML-ProjectKart/tree/patch-33/Advertisement%20Click%20Prediction/Dataset) folder too, you can access that!

## Goal
The goal of this project is to make a prediction model using the advertisement classification algortihms, which will predict the desired ad as per the user information.

## What have I done?
1. Importing all the required libraries. Check [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/abhisheks008/ML-ProjectKart/blob/patch-33/Advertisement%20Click%20Prediction/requirements.txt).
2. Upload the dataset and the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Prediction Models

## Model Comparison
We have deployed ten machine learning algorithms and every algorithm is deployed successfully without any hesitation. We have checked the accuracy of the models based on the accuracy score of each of the models. Now let's take a look at the scores of each models.

|Name of the Model|Accuracy Score|
|:---:|:---:|
|Logistic Regression|0.87|
|Decision Tree Classifier|0.86|
|Random Forest Classifier|0.92|
|Naive Bayes Algorithm|0.88|
|KNN Algorithm|0.93|
|Support Vector Machine Algorithm|0.92|
|Gradient Boosting Algorithm|0.89|
|AdaBoosting Classifier|0.86|
|Artificial Neural Network|0.93|
|XgBoost Classifier Algorithm|0.89|


*****************************************

## Conclusion

**Comparing all those scores scored by the machine learning algorithms, it is clear that KNN and MLP Classifier Algorithm are having the upper hand in case of this dataset and after this, we can use Random Forest Classifier and SVM algorithm, which are also having good score as compared to the other deployed algorithms**

Best Fitted Models ranking - 
1. K-Nearest Neighbouring Algortihms
2. MLP Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Gradient Boosting
6. XgBoosting Classifier
7. Naive Bayes Classifier
8. Logistic Regression
9. Decision Tree Classifier
10. AdaBoost Classifier

Hooray!! The models are deployed successfully!
