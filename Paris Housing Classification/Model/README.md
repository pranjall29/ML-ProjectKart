**GOAL**

The goal is to predict Paris Housing.

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mssmartypants/paris-housing-classification?select=ParisHousingClass.csv)

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

   1. Discussed some major columns on which the category of the paris houses depends.
   2. Handling outliers of diagnosis columns. As, it is very important because at last we're predicting paris houses.
   3. Then I used different classification models present in sklearn to train the model.
   4. Use Correlation coefficients to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables.

**MODELS USED**

    1. Naive Bayes
    2. Decision Tree
    3. Random Forest
    4. Support Vector Machine
    5. K Nearest Neighbors

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

    1. numpy
    2. pandas
    3. seaborn
    4. matplotlib
    5. scikit-learn

**Conclusion**

By using Naive Bayes I got
```
   The Accuracy of Training Data:  87.52857142857144
   The Accuracy of Testing Data:  86.93333333333332
```
By using Decision Tree I got
```
   The Accuracy of Training Data:  87.6
   The Accuracy of Testing Data:  88.43333333333334
```
By using Random Forest I got
```
   The Accuracy of Training Data:  87.52857142857144
   The Accuracy of Testing Data:  86.93333333333332
```
By using SVM I got
```
   The Accuracy of Training Data:  87.52857142857144
   The Accuracy of Testing Data:  86.93333333333332
```
By using KNN I got
```
   The Accuracy of Training Data:  87.61428571428571
   The Accuracy of Testing Data:  86.53333333333333
```
