# EMPLOYEE-RETENTION-PROJECT


## AIM / OBJECTIVE 
The project revolves around the idea to  give basic modelling techniques used to classify if the employee will leave the company or not based on certain features in the datset.

## FOLDERS

1. Dataset :
This folder contains the dataset used for the analysis and modelling. It has 2 datsets one from HR of the commpany and one from employees.


2. Models :
This folder contains the colab notebook prepared using different classification models like decision trees , random forest , KNN and logistic regression .

3. Images :
This folder contains few of the insights i drew from analysis and visual modeling comparision.


## DESCRIPTION AND STEPS
This project contains the python colab notebook for employee retention project which includes

1. Loading and Exploring dataset
2. Merging datasets 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Some insights with Visualizations
5. ML Models for Classification

6. Evaluation of Different Models

## LIBRARIES USED 

The libraries used are : 
1. Pandas 
2. Numpy
3. Sklearn
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib

## CONCLUSION 

The conclusion one could draw from the analysis is :

1. Most of the employees who didn't got promotion in the last few years and whose salary wasn't increased left the company.
2. Also the Satisfaction Level was an important feature among the analysis.
3. After different modelling technques used for classification , we could figure out that model having relatively higher accuracy is :  **Random Forest** giving **~98%** accuracy.

   Further **Logistics Regression** gave **~78%** and **KNN** and **Decision Tree** gave **~96%** and **~97%** accuracies respectively.
