The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.
The training data set, (train.csv), has 785 columns. The first column, called "label", is the digit that was drawn by the user. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 color images of 32 x 32 pixels in 3 channels divided into 10 classes.
Each class contains 6,000 images. The training set contains 50,000 images, while the test sets provides 10,000 images.
This image taken from the CIFAR repository ( https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html ). This is a classification problem with 10 classes(muti-label classification). 
We can take a view on this image for more comprehension of the dataset.
