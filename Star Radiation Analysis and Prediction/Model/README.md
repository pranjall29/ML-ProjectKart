# Star Radiation Analysis and Pediction

## Goal

The aim of the project is to analysis the dataset , prediction the project and
perform a detailed analysis and visualization of the training dataset and create a model. 

## Dataset
The dataset which is used here, is collected from Kaggle website. Here is the link of the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/eswarchandt/phishing-website-detector. I have uploaded the same in [`Dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/dronio/SolarEnergy) folder too, you can access that!

## WHAT I HAD DONE

### Data Extraction
1. Loading Dataset
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Model
1. Created Model
2. Predicted on Test data





## MODELS USED

 - Linear Regression 
 - Polynimial Regression
 - Random Forest Regression

|Name of the Model|Accuracy Score|
|:---:|:---:|
|Logistic Regression|59|
|Polynimial Regression|67|
|Random Forest Regression|84|
 
## LIBRARIES NEEDED

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- ploty
- warning

## Conclusion

In this project we have performed  analysis and visualization of the training dataset with different Exploratory Data Analysis techniques. 
Then we used different Regressors to predict the Ladder score. After performing the model comparative 
analysis we can conclude that Linear Regressor gave the best Result out of all.

Best Fitted Models ranking - 
1. Random forest classifier
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Linear Regression
